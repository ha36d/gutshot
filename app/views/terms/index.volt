            <ul>
                <li>No-one under the age of 18 or the age of legal consent for engaging in the activities included in

                    the Software or use the Services under any circumstances and any person not Legally of Age who
                    downloads the Software or uses the Services will be in breach of the terms of the User Agreement.
                    The Company reserves the right to request proof of age at any stage, to verify that persons not
                    Legally of Age are not using the Services. The Company may terminate your account and/or exclude you
                    from using the Software or the Services if proof of age is not provided by you or if the Company
                    suspects that you are not Legally of Age. The Company reserves the right to withhold any funds in
                    your account until your age is verified.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>We reserve the right to verify your registration details, such as name, address, age, and payment
                    methods used, at any time, by requesting certain documents. These documents shall typically include
                    an identity card, proof of address such as a utility bill, and proof of your payment method, and can
                    be uploaded through the Cashier. If deemed necessary, we may request that the said document copies
                    are notarized, meaning that the documents are stamped and attested by a Public Notary. In the event
                    our requests for documents are not completed by the member, the Company may at its sole discretion
                    terminate the account, and withhold any funds that are present therein. Should the documents fail
                    our internal security checks – for example, if we suspect that they have been tampered with, or are
                    in any way provided to mislead or misrepresent – we shall be under no obligation to accept such
                    documents as valid, and under no obligation to provide feedback on the exact nature of our findings
                    with regards to these documents.

                    documentation, for any reason, including (but not limited to) any investigation into the identity of
                    the member, any credit checks performed on the member, or any enquiries into the member's personal
                    history. The basis for such investigations will be dependent on the specific case, but could include
                    (but is not limited to) verification of the member’s registration details, such as the name, address
                    and age, verification of the member’s financial transactions, financial standing, and/or gaming
                    activity. The Company is under no obligation to advise the member of such an investigation taking
                    place. Such activities may include the use of specific third party companies, who perform the
                    investigations as required. The Company may decide at its sole discretion to terminate a member’s
                    account, and withhold all funds in such account, on the basis that such an investigation provides a
                    negative or uncertain conclusion.

                    card previously used by you. Should any of the information that you provide to us be untrue,
                    inaccurate, misleading or otherwise incomplete, you will be in breach of contract and we reserve the

            <ul>
                <li>Illegal Funds and Unlawful Activities: You declare that the source of funds used by you for
                    gambling on the Sites is not illegal and that you will not use the Services in any way as a money
                    transfer system. You will not use the Services for any unlawful or fraudulent activity or prohibited
                    transaction (including money laundering) under the laws of any jurisdiction that applies to you (in
                    particular, the laws of Gutshot). If the Company has a reasonable suspicion that you may be
                    engaging in or have engaged in fraudulent, unlawful or improper activity, including, without
                    limitation, money laundering activities, or conduct otherwise in violation of the User Agreement,
                    your access to the Services may be terminated immediately and/or your account blocked. If your
                    account is terminated or blocked in such circumstances, the Company is under no obligation to refund
                    to you any funds that may be in your account. In addition to terminating your access to the Services
                    and/or blocking your account, the Company reserves the right to prevent you from accessing any of
                    the Company's other websites or servers, or accessing any other services offered by the Company. The
                    Company shall be entitled to inform relevant authorities, other online service providers and banks,
                    credit card companies, electronic payment providers or other financial institutions (together
                    "Interested Third Parties") of your identity and of any suspected unlawful, fraudulent or improper
                    activity and you will cooperate fully with the Company to investigate any such activity. In the
                    interests of fair play on our Sites it is prohibited to utilise any recognised betting techniques to
                    circumvent the standard house edge in our games. If the game play on your account indicates that you
                    are using such betting techniques we shall immediately block the account and retain any funds in
                    said account.

                <li>Circumvention: We have developed and employ sophisticated proprietary technology intended to

                    not break into, access or attempt to break into or access or otherwise circumvent the Company's
                    security measures. If, the Company believes, in its sole discretion, that you are in breach of this
                    clause, the Company may terminate your access to the Services immediately and/or have your account
                    blocked, and the Company may inform Interested Third Parties of your breach of this clause.

            <ul>
                <li>Software Aids: You are not allowed to use any software program or robot which, in our
                    opinion, is endowed with artificial intelligence ("Software Aid") in connection with your use of the
                    Services. We constantly review the use of the Services in order to detect the use of any Software
                    Aid. In the event that we have reasonable suspicion that any Software Aid has been used, we reserve
                    the right to take any action we see fit, including immediately blocking access to the Services to
                    the offending user, terminating such user's account and seizing all monies held in such account.

                <li>Intentional Disconnection: You are not allowed to intentionally disconnect from a game while
                    playing on the Sites. We have developed and employ elaborate methods which enable us to seek out and
                    accurately identify users who carry out an intentional disconnection during a game. If, in the
                    Company's sole discretion, you are in breach of this clause, the Company may terminate your access
                    to the Services immediately and/or have your account blocked. If your account is terminated or
                    blocked in such circumstances, the Company is under no obligation to refund to you any funds that
                    may be in your account. In addition to terminating your access to the Services and/or blocking your
                    account, the Company reserves the right to prevent you from accessing any of the Company's other
                    websites or servers, or accessing any other services offered by the Company.

                <li>Should you fail to use your account for six months your account will be considered a "dormant
                    account". The six-month period will run from the date of your last login to your account. In the
                    case of a dormant account, the Company will levy a monthly administration fee at a rate of 10% of
                    the balance in the account on the date that it became dormant. For the purposes of this
                    administration fee: (a) the fee shall be deemed to be deducted first from funds deposited by you
                    into your account and, when no such funds remain, from winnings and (b) where available, winnings
                    will be wagered in preference to original capital when any bet is placed. The administration fee
                    shall be deducted from the dormant account commencing from the last day of the sixth month in which
                    the account is inactive and on the last day of every month thereafter, until the balance of the
                    account has reached zero. In the event that you login to your account during the ten-month period
                    during which the administration fee is levied, the Company will cease to levy the administration fee
                    but shall not be obligated to return to you any monies already deducted from the account at such
                    time.

                <li>In the event that you contract with Virtual Digital Services Limited, we may charge you a fee in
                    relation to any bet or deposit you make. You expressly agree to pay such a fee, if charged, and
                    acknowledge that this fee is imposed in order to offset the impact of the requirement to pay VAT (or
                    its equivalent in your location) in connection with your gaming activity which may be payable to
                    your government in the applicable jurisdiction where you place your bet. Any fee in relation to your
                    deposits will be detailed in the cashier and updated from time to time. You acknowledge
                    that we may update the fees in relation to bets from time to time and any modified version will take
                    effect 14 days after its publication on the applicable Internet site or earlier if required by any
                    applicable law, regulation or directive and your continued use of the Services or the Software after
                    the aforementioned period will be deemed to constitute your acceptance of the changes.

                    cashed-out to members where currency conversion is involved. The effect of this policy shall be that
                    deposit or cash-out amounts in currencies other than US Dollars might be rounded up or down on
                    conversion to or from US Dollars. By way of example only, if according to the exchange rate a 10 EUR
                    deposit is converted by the Company into 13.61 USD then your account will be credited with 14.00
                    USD. Details of the rounding policy in effect from time to time will be available to you at the
                    point that any monies are converted.

            <ul>
                <li>Each user of the Service is fully responsible for paying all monies owed to the Company. You agree
                    that you will not make or attempt to make any charge-backs, and/or deny or reverse any payment that
                    you have made and you hereby agree that you will reimburse the Company for any charge-backs, denial
                    or reversal of payments you make and any loss suffered by the Company as a consequence thereof. The
                    Company may, at its sole discretion, cease to provide the Services or withhold payment to certain
                    users or to users paying with certain credit cards.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Gutshot Enterprises Limited will process your payments and handle your funds and will
                    therefore appear on your credit card statements (or on other payment statements as applicable).
                    Subject to regulatory requirements, the Company may, from time to time, at its sole discretion and
                    without notice, use any other company within the same corporate group to provide such services.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>We reserve the right to run credit checks on all users with third party credit agencies, on the
                    basis of the information provided to us on registration.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>We reserve the right to use third party electronic payment processors and/or financial institutions
                    to process payments made by and to you in connection with your use of the Services. To the extent
                    that they do not conflict with the terms of the User Agreement, you agree to be bound by the terms
                    and conditions of such third party electronic payment processors and/or financial institutions.

                <li>In the case we have reasonable suspicion that a fraudulent payment is being made or received,
                    including use of stolen credit cards, or any other fraudulent activity (including any charge-back or
                    other reversal of a payment), we reserve the right to block or terminate a user's account, reverse
                    any pay-out made and recover any winnings. We shall be entitled to inform any relevant authorities
                    or entities (including credit reference agencies) of any payment fraud or otherwise unlawful
                    activity, and may employ collection services to recover payments. However, under no circumstances
                    shall the Company be liable for any unauthorized use of credit cards, irrespective of whether or not
                    the credit cards were reported stolen.

            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Our expectation is that our members will deposit in order to actively play with their own funds. On
                    accounts where this does not seem to be the case, we reserve the right to enforce a wagering amount
                    on your deposited funds, before allowing any withdrawal from said account. This wagering amount will
                    be a multiplication of the total deposited funds, which we will specify depending on the case (for
                    example 1 x the deposited amount). We reserve the right to require this wagering to be performed in
                    specific games, and to exclude certain low risk bets or game types, at our discretion.

            <p>10. Bonuses</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All promotions, bonuses or special offers are subject to promotion-specific terms and conditions and
                    any complimentary bonus credited to your account must be used in adherence with such terms and
                    conditions. Notwithstanding the modification provisions in Section 2, we reserve the right to
                    withdraw or amend any promotion, bonus or special offer at any time including any terms and
                    conditions thereof.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>In the event that the Company has reasonable suspicion that a user of the Service is abusing or
                    attempting to abuse a bonus, offer or other promotion, or is likely to benefit through abuse or lack
                    of good faith from a gambling policy adopted by the Company, then the Company may, at its sole
                    discretion, deny, withhold or withdraw from any user any bonus, offer or promotion, or rescind any
                    policy with respect to that user, either temporarily or permanently, or terminate that user's access
                    to the Services and/or block that user's account.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>All users of the Services shall be entitled only to one welcome bonus. Members who make their first
                    deposit with the Company or any of its white label partners, and who have or previously had an
                    account with any of the Sites owned or operated by the Company, including both In-House Brands and
                    White Label Brands, shall not be entitled to an additional welcome bonus, unless the Company decides
                    otherwise at its absolute discretion.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Your account is made up of both Available funds (those that can be used in any applicable game or
                    withdrawn subject to the Withdrawal Policy) and Restricted funds (the total of bonus funds that have
                    not yet met the wagering requirement and any winnings associated with such bonus funds). If you have
                    both Available funds and Restricted funds in your account, the next wager you make will use
                    Restricted funds first. Available funds will only be used once your Restricted funds balance is
                    zero. If you place a wager on casino games using Restricted funds only and win you will receive,
                    depending on your account currency, up to a maximum of $500/€500/£500 in winnings. If your winnings
                    exceed $500/€500/£500 you will only receive $500/€500/£500. Such limitation on your winnings shall
                    not apply to verified progressive jackpot winnings derived from Restricted funds.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The jackpot prizes will not increase as a result of wagers made with Restricted funds, free spins or
                    FreePlay. Only wagers with Available funds shall increase the jackpot prizes.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>In the event that the Company has reasonable suspicion that you have been taking unfair advantage of
                    the Company's welcome bonuses or have executed any other act in bad faith in relation to a bonus
                    promotion offered on any of the Sites owned and/or operated by the Company, the Company shall have
                    the right to block or terminate your accounts with the Company and in such circumstances, the
                    Company shall be under no obligation to refund to you any funds that may be in your account.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>If we have reasonable suspicion that an account or group of accounts are operating systematically –
                    for example employing specific wagering techniques or wagering as a group, the Company shall have
                    the right to block or terminate all accounts and in such circumstances, the Company shall be under
                    no obligation to refund to you any funds that may be in your account.

            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>You may request the removal of a bonus from your account, but please be aware that this removal may
                    include any winnings gained from such bonus.

            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Please be advised that the 'confirm your ID' bonus is issued at the Company's discretion and
                    therefore may not be available for all members who verify their identity with us. Notwithstanding
                    the modification provisions in Section 2, we reserve the right to remove this bonus offer at any
                    time. Certain criteria will be taken into consideration when determining which members will receive
                    the verification bonus, such as registration country, deposit amount, deposit payment type, and
                    other details of the account. Please contact <a href="mailto:operations@Gutshot.net">operations@Gutshot.net</a>

            <p>24. Multi-Currency in Casino</p>

            <p>If you have chosen to have your casino bankroll currency in GBP or EUR, it is strongly recommended that
                you upgrade all versions of casino that you may have installed to the latest version which provides full
                multi-currency functionality. Should you choose to enter an old casino version that has not yet been
                upgraded, there will be various inaccuracies in the display for which we take no responsibility
                whatsoever; For example, the game history of rounds played in your registered currency will appear with
                the wrong currency symbol and the correct history could be viewed only in the new casino version.</p>

                <br>
                You hereby agree that in the event that the Live Casino is disconnected due to unsuitable hardware,
                software and/or connection configurations on the player's part, we shall be under no obligation to
                refund such player and the Company will not be responsible for any loss, including loss of winnings,
                which may result.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Poker</p>

            <p>You hereby acknowledge that all bets placed by you in relation to multi-player poker games are bets
                placed with other users and not bets placed with or against the Company. The Company does not assume any
                risk whatsoever for bets placed between you and any other user of the Service. The Company does not
                under any circumstances either place or accept bets itself.
                <br>
                You understand and agree that all of our multi-player poker games are public and therefore may be
                reviewed and published by other players, either at the time of the game or thereafter.
                <br>
                We provide multi-player poker games so as to provide a platform for users to play poker and to bet with
                each other using the Software. In consideration of this service we charge either:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>a commission (known as a rake) which is calculated in accordance with the House Rules; or</li>
                <li>a percentage of the "buy-in" fee for tournaments.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Collusion: Collusion occurs when two or more players at a poker table attempt to gain an unfair
                advantage by sharing knowledge of their cards or other information. Any player who colludes or attempts
                to collude with any other player while using the Service may be permanently banned from using the
                Service or the Software or any other related services of the Company, their account may be terminated
                immediately and the Company shall be entitled to retain all monies in such player's account. We have
                developed and employ sophisticated proprietary technology intended to seek out and identify players
                acting in collusion. If the Company is informed about suspected collusive behavior, it may, in its sole
                discretion, terminate suspected players' access to the Service and/or block their accounts and withhold
                all available funds from within the accounts. No player shall have the right to require the Company to
                take any other steps against players suspected of collusion, cheating or any other form of fraud.
                <br>
                If you suspect that any player is colluding with another or cheating, you can contact us via email at <a
                        href="mailto:info@gutshot.club">info@gutshot.club</a> or via the support email address
                relevant to a White Label Brand.
                <br>
                Chip-Dumping: Chip-dumping occurs when any player deliberately loses a hand in order to
                deliberately transfer his chips to another player. Any player who is involved in an act of chip-dumping
                or attempted chip-dumping while using the Service may be permanently banned from using the Service or
                the Software or any other related services of the Company and such player's account may be terminated
                immediately. If the Company is informed about suspected Chip-Dumping, it may, in its sole discretion,
                terminate suspected players' access to the Service and/or block their accounts and all monies in such
                player's account. In such circumstances the Company will be under no obligation to refund to the
                relevant player any funds that may be in the account at such time.
                <br>
                If we reasonably suspect that an account or group of accounts are operating systematically in order to
                gain an advantage over another player or to commit any act in bad faith in relation to the other players
                or the Company – for example employing specific techniques to disadvantage other players or playing as a
                group, the Company shall have the right to block or terminate all such accounts and in such
                circumstances, the Company shall be under no obligation to refund to you any funds that may be in your
                account.
                <br>
                Seating Aids: Without derogating from the prohibited use of Software Aids, you are not allowed to
                use any software program or external aid which, in our opinion, enables you to find a seat at a poker
                table or automatically seats you at a poker table ("Seating Aid"). We constantly review the use of the
                Services in order to detect the use of Seating Aids and in the event that we deem it has been used we
                reserve the right to take any action we see fit, including immediately blocking access to the Services
                to the offending user, terminating such user's account and seizing all monies held in such account.
                <br>
                Abuse of the "Sit Out" Feature: The “Sit Out” feature is only intended for taking short breaks
                between extended periods of play. It is not intended for use while no play is taking place at the table,
                or for waiting on players to join or leave the table. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to take
                action against players "sitting out" for excessive periods of time. Players who repeatedly abuse the
                "Sit Out" feature may be restricted from participating in our poker games either temporarily or
                indefinitely.
                <br>
                Payment Disputes: Each user of the Service is fully responsible for paying any and all monies
                owed by it to other users of the Service and/or the Company. Any claim which a user of the Service may
                have for payment of winnings to it in respect of losing bets placed by another user of the Service are
                against that other user and not the Company. The Company is in no way responsible to pay you if any user
                of the Service fails to pay his debts for whatever reason, or for taking any action whatsoever against
                such users. All disputes that arise between users of the Service, including those relating to payment
                fraud, are not the responsibility of the Company.
                <br>
                If your account is associated with poker fraud in any way – for example through Chip Dumping, Collusion,
                or the receipt of fraudulent Money Transfers – your account may be terminated, and we will be under no
                obligation to refund to you the funds from your account. This is irrespective of whether your account
                can be proven as intentionally receiving funds from a fraudulent user.
                <br>
                In the event of a poker fraud investigation we are under no obligation to accept any explanation
                provided for the receipt or use of fraudulent funds. If such an investigation is resolved, and your
                account is reopened, we may choose to remove the amount of fraudulent funds from your bankroll.
                <br>
                Money Transfers – If you choose to send a money transfer to any account, once the amount and the
                recipient username has been confirmed, such transfer is irreversible, and we will not be responsible for
                any loss of funds caused by the member transferring monies to the wrong account. However, the Company at
                its sole discretion reserves the right to reverse any money transfer which it suspects of being
                fraudulent or connected with any illegal activity.
                <br>
                If your account receives funds via money transfer from accounts that have security issues, we reserve
                the right to block your account and withhold any funds, until such security issues are resolved on all
                accounts – including those that you received money transfers from. No player shall have the right to
                require the Company to take any steps against players suspected of collusion, cheating or any other form
                of fraud. The Company will not provide information with regards to investigations or any subsequent
                outcome. You are fully aware that there is a risk of losing money when gambling by means of the Services
                and you are fully responsible for any such loss. You agree that your use of the Services is at your sole
                option, discretion and risk. Other than as stated herein, in relation to your losses you shall have no
                claims whatsoever against the Company and any of its affiliated entities or any white label partner or
                their respective directors, officers or employees.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Live Poker</p>

            <p>In order to play at the live poker video tables, you will need to have a video camera attached to your
                computer.
                <br>
                Players who sit out in a live poker game will be removed from the video table in order to free up the
                seat for other players on the waiting list (if such waiting list is not empty).
                <br>
                We reserve the right to limit the number of players "viewing" the live poker video tables and change
                such number from time to time at our sole discretion.
                <br>
                Your use of the live poker video tables is subject to the following rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You shall not make any statements or otherwise behave in a manner that is sexually explicit or
                    grossly offensive, including any expressions of bigotry, racism, hatred or profanity around the
                    table.
                </li>
                <li>You shall not make any statements or otherwise behave in a manner that is abusive, defamatory or
                    harassing or insulting to other players at the table.
                </li>
                <li>You shall not make statements or otherwise behave in any manner that attempts to exploit the game
                    for purposes of advertising or promoting any commercial or private interests.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the event of your breaching any of the above provisions relating to misconduct at the live poker video
                tables, the Company shall have the right to remove you from the poker room or take any other action
                deemed necessary, including either temporary suspension or permanent termination of your account. In
                addition, the Company has the right to deny prizes in promotions related to poker video tables to any
                entrants that it deems have breached any of the rules, including deliberately covering or obstructing
                the camera.
                <br>
                Nevertheless, the Company shall not be responsible for any images posted on the webcams or for comments
                by our members thereon, and we will not be held liable for any perceived insult or injury. The Company
                is not required to monitor such images and comments, or to inform you of any actions taken against a
                member once a complaint has been made.
                <br>
                Your participation in the live poker video table will be deemed to be your agreement for the Company to
                use your name, audio, likeness, image and country for promotional and marketing purposes as it sees fit
                without the requirement for any payment and you hereby grant the Company the right to do so.
                <br>
                You acknowledge and agree that the Company may film and photograph the poker tables as well as stream
                live videos from same on the Sites.
                <br>
                You further understand and agree that by entering the live poker table any other players at the table
                will also be able to use and publish your image and audio without the Company's control and you shall
                have no claims against the Company in such regard.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Bonuses</p>

            <p>If we reasonably suspect that a member is abusing any of our deposit related bonuses in any way, we may
                choose to terminate the account, and any related accounts across our Services, and withhold any funds
                from such accounts. A suspicion of abuse may be based on the repeated patterns of
                deposit/cashout/redeposit purely intended to gain the deposit related bonus.
                <br>
                If we reasonably suspect that the member is abusing our free sites and free games offers, we may choose
                to terminate the account, and any related accounts across our Services, and withhold any funds from such
                accounts. If we reasonably suspect that the member is abusing the spirit of the free games sites – for
                example, by playing repeatedly only with free games, or by purchasing all the tickets for a free game,
                we may choose to close the account, and any related accounts across our Services, and withhold any funds
                from such accounts.
                <br>
                If we have reason to suspect that an account or group of accounts are operating systematically – for
                example employing specific wagering techniques or wagering as a group, the Company shall have the right
                to block or terminate all accounts and in such circumstances, the Company shall be under no obligation
                to refund to you any funds that may be in your account.</p>

                contradiction between the UK Terms and the other terms of the User Agreement, the UK Terms will
                apply.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you are under the age of 18 and you download or use the Services you are committing a criminal
                    offence in the UK.
                </li>
                <li>If your age is not verified by 888 UK Limited within 72 hours of your first deposit with us, your
                    account will be frozen and no further gambling will be permitted until 888 UK Limited has
                    successfully verified your age. 888 UK Limited reserves the right to withhold any funds in your
                    account until your age is verified. If on completion of the age verification process you are shown
                    to be underage, 888 UK Limited will return to you your original deposit amount but no winnings shall
                    be paid to you.
                </li>
                <li>Please note that the Designated Account of players in the UK (the term “Designated Account” is
                    defined in Section 8 of the User Agreement) meets the UK Gambling Commission’s requirements at the
                    medium segregation level because we hold player funds separate from Company funds in this account,
                    which is designated as a client account and subject to specific instructions as to how these funds
                    are to be treated. This means that steps have been taken to protect customer funds but there is no
                    absolute guarantee that all funds will be repaid if the Company should at any time become insolvent.
